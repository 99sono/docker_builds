Those scripts require a significant change. They are currently written as if they should be placed within the Docker container and called from within. Instead, I was expecting scripts that reside outside the container and execute via the Docker exec command, similar to scripts like `development_image/01_build_base_software_image/verify/08_verify_sshd_config.sh`.  Furthermore, a script like `development_image/01_build_base_software_image/verify/01_A_run_built_container_entrypoint_script.sh` should be used to start the container built with the `development_image/02_build_dev_environments_image/build.sh` script.
