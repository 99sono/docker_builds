# Merge Request Guidelines

All merge requests should follow this structure for consistency. Not every section will be needed for every MR - include relevant sections that add value.

## Summary
High-level overview of what the MR accomplishes. Keep it to 3-5 sentences.

## Details
Explain the implementation and rationale. Include any alternatives considered and why this approach was chosen.

### Main Changes Overview
Bullet point summary of the major changes made.

## Summary of Files Changed
List of files added and modified, with brief notes on what each one changed.

- **New files**: `path/to/file.ext` - what it does
- **Modified files**: `path/to/file.ext` - what changed

## Most Important Changes
Highlight the 3-5 changes that reviewers should pay close attention to, with brief explanations of why they matter.

## Additional Sections (Optional)
Add Implementation Notes, Testing Considerations, or other sections only if they meaningfully help reviewers understand technical details or testing requirements.

**Template**: See `merge-request-template.md` for a practical example.
