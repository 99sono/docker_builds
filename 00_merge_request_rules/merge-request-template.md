# Add GitHub Workflow, Docker Hub Publishing, and Network Utilities

## Summary

This feature branch adds GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated build testing, creates infrastructure for publishing Docker images to Docker Hub, enhances the base Docker image with network debugging tools, and provides comprehensive documentation.

Key highlights:
- **`iputils-ping`** added to enable network troubleshooting within containers
- **GitHub Actions workflow** validates builds on every push/PR
- **Docker Hub publishing scripts** enable manual publication to public repository
- **Documentation infrastructure** for maintaining Docker Hub repository README

## Details

This change introduces a complete publishing pipeline while maintaining the existing local development workflow. The workflow ensures build reliability through automated testing while providing manual publishing capabilities for experimental container images.

### Main Changes Overview

1. **Enhanced Base Image**: Added `iputils-ping` package for network connectivity testing in containers
2. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and validates all container layers
3. **Publishing Infrastructure**: Complete set of scripts for Docker Hub publication workflow
4. **Documentation Framework**: Organized documentation for both local and public repositories

## Summary of Files Changed

### New Files Added:
- **`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow for CI validation
- **`development_image/06_publish_to_public_repo/`** (entire folder): Publishing scripts and documentation
  - `README.md`: Publishing workflow documentation
  - `01_tag_latest_created_image_before_publish_to_github.sh`: Image tagging script
  - `02_push_tagged_image_to_docker_hub.sh`: Image push script with authentication checks
  - `03_delete_docker_hub_tag.sh`: Tag management utilities
- **`development_image/07_docker_hub_image_readme/`** (entire folder): Docker Hub repository documentation
  - `README.md`: Documentation coordination guide
  - `dockerhub-image-description.md`: Comprehensive Docker Hub README

### Modified Files:
- **`development_image/01_build_base_software_image/Dockerfile`**: Added `iputils-ping` to networking tools list
- **`development_image/00_common_env.sh`**: Added Docker Hub configuration variables (`DOCKER_HUB_REPO_NAME` and `DOCKER_HUB_TAG`)

## Most Important Changes

### **Network Debugging Enhancement** (`development_image/01_build_base_software_image/Dockerfile`)
The addition of `iputils-ping` significantly improves container debugging capabilities. Previously, containers could not run `ping` for network connectivity tests, making troubleshooting connectivity issues challenging. This small addition greatly enhances the development environment's utility for network-aware applications.

### **CI/CD Infrastructure** (`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`)
The new GitHub Actions workflow ensures that all container layers build successfully on every code change. This prevents regression issues where Dockerfile changes might break the build pipeline. The workflow runs on pushes to main and pull requests, providing confidence that changes don't break container builds.

### **Docker Hub Publishing Workflow** (`development_image/06_publish_to_public_repo/`)
The complete publishing infrastructure transforms this local Docker build project into a public container distribution system. The scripts handle tagging, authentication verification, and publication - enabling the container image to be shared with the broader development community.

## Implementation Notes (Optional - included as example)

*This section is included in the template to demonstrate an optional section that adds value.*

- **Agentic Tool Used**: xAI Grok code-fast via Cline - responsible for code generation and documentation
- **Repository Structure**: Maintains organized folder structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Configuration Management**: Uses environment variables for flexible Docker Hub configuration
- **Security**: Includes authentication verification and follows Docker Hub best practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for both users and maintainers

## Testing Considerations (Optional - included as example)
